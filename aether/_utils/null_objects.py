    A pure identity: ``transform()`` hands back exactly what it was given, and the
    device/precision hooks are genuine no-ops. Model.finalize() installs this
    unconditionally so the per-batch dispatch can call ``.transform()`` with zero
    ``is not None`` branching in the hot loop -- the same role NullOptimizer and
    NullAccuracy play elsewhere in the codebase.

    Deliberately does NOT absorb device migration or precision casting. Every
    finalized model owns one of these, so a migrating null object would silently
    add a host->device copy to every batch of every pipeline-free model -- exactly
    the per-step PCIe traffic that Model._assert_device_alignment exists to forbid.
    Device strictness stays with that guard; device migration stays with an
    explicit ToTensor the user opted into.
